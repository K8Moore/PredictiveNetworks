# PredictiveNetworks

This code was developed for a course in Machine Learning that I TA'ed during the Fall and Spring of 2019 at my university. It is designed to run a multilayer perceptron (aka. a feed forward neural network) with two hidden layers on the iris dataset using the keras Sequential interface. The iris data set can be imported via the following link: http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/iris.csv. The code selects the number of hidden units using GridSearchCV, then evaluates each model on a test-set. The code highlights the predictive accuracy and the predictice strength of each model (e.g. models with different numbers of hidden units) in order to better evaluate their differences and distinguish between more and less desireable hyper-parameters.
